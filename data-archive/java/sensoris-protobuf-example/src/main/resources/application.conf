## Optional properties recommended to be overridden in application.conf ##
##########################################################################

# These settings are for Data Archiving Library's source (Stream Layer).
source {

  # This property is valid only when using http-connector for stream layer. The number of subscriptions cannot exceed the parallelism allowed by stream layer.
  # When consumer needs to recover (in case of failure), if same consumer-group and consumer-id values are used, then old subscription will be re-used.
  consumer-id = "<UPDATE_ME>"    # Eg:- consumer-id = "my-unique-consumer-id"
}

# These settings are for Data Archiving Library's aggregation logic.
aggregation {

  # The Data Archiving Library splits the stream into "buckets" of time interval.
  # For all elements in each bucket, the stream is also split into logical keyed streams based on indexing attributes of each element.
  # This property decides how long the user wants the Data Archiving Pipeline to aggregate the data in memory before archiving to Index Layer.
  # Note that if the value is very small, it will impact the performance of archiving as smaller files will be archived frequently.
  # However, if the value is very big, it requires higher storage requirement (more workers/worker units) to hold the data in disk and memory.
  # For state size consideration, note that Flink creates one copy of each element per window to which it belongs.
  # Default value is set to 15 minutes. The recommended value range is from 10 minutes to 60 minutes. Allowed value range is from 1 second to 24 hours.
  # The value should also be less than or equal to stream layer's time-to-live (ttl) retention period value. The recommendation for the value is to be much smaller than the stream layer ttl.
  # If these two values are too close, there is risk of data expiring from stream layer before it is processed by the pipeline.
  window-seconds = <UPDATE_ME>    # Eg:- window-seconds = 1200

  # Having a keyed stream allows the windowed computation to be performed in parallel by multiple tasks, as each logical keyed stream can be processed independently from the rest.
  # In each aggregation window, all elements referring to the same key will be sent to the same parallel task.
  # Assuming there is no hotspot problem (most if not all elements have the same key), having higher parallelism will improve the data archiving pipeline performance.
  # Required parallelism can be determined by different parameters like indexing attributes cardinality, uniqueness, etc. Please refer Best Practices section in the developer guide for details.
  # It is highly recommended to override this property. Note that the value of this property should be less than or equal to number of workers selected when creating a pipeline.
  parallelism = <UPDATE_ME>    # Eg:- parallelism = 10
}

# These settings allows you to specify what your pipeline will do when an error occurs in your User Defined Function (UDF) implementation.
# The Data Archiving Library will invoke the error handling strategy when:
# - A UDF implementation throws a non-parsable message
# - A UDF implementation returns an unchecked/runtime exception
# - A UDF implementation returns null
# - An indexing attribute value does not pass the Data Archiving Library's validation rules.
# The error handling strategy you choose does not apply to error scenarios in a User-Defined Function's `merge()` function.
# This is because the `merge()` function is only used for the Data Archiving Library's internal optimization process of compaction. Any failures in this process will not fail your archiving pipeline.
error {
  # You can choose one of the following error handling strategies:
  # - "fail" - The pipeline fails on any error from a User-Defined Function's implementation. The pipeline logs the action.
  # - "ignore" - The pipeline ignores the messages that encounter an error in a User-Defined Function's implementation. The pipeline logs the action and continues processing the next message. This is the default strategy.
  # - "deadletter" - The pipeline archives messages that encounter an error in a User-Defined Function's implementation. The messages are archived in a dead letter index layer, and processing continues. See the following section for more information about using this strategy.
  strategy = <UPDATE_ME>    # Eg:- strategy = "fail"

  # For "deadletter" strategy,
  # Create an index layer for archiving messages that encounter an error.
  # This special index layer must have following settings:
  # - Content Type must be "application/x-avro-binary".
  # - Content Encoding must be "uncompressed".
  # - There must be four indexing attributes with following names and settings:
  #   - A `timewindow` type attribute with the name "indexUploadTime". You can select the desired `duration`. This attribute stores the timestamp of the index upload, truncated by the duration value.
  #   - A `string` type attribute with the name "realm". This attribute stores the realm of the index layer where messages that were successfully processed are indexed.
  #   - A `string` type attribute with the name "catalogId". This attribute stores the `catalogId` of the index layer where messages that were successfully processed are indexed.
  #   - A `string` type attribute with name "layerId". This attribute stores the `layerId` of the index layer where messages that were successfully processed are indexed.
  # - You can select any TTL setting.
  # Add following two commented parameters in your application.conf (uncomment and update with correct values).
  # deadletter.hrn = "<CATALOG_HRN_WHERE_YOU_WANT_TO_STORE_MESSAGES_IN_CASE_OF_ERRORS>"    # Eg:- deadletter.hrn = "hrn:here:data::olp-here:sensor-data-deadletter-avro" or deadletter.hrn = "hrn:here-cn:data::olp-cn-here:sensor-data-deadletter-avro" (for China)
  # deadletter.layer = "<INDEX_LAYER_NAME_WHERE_YOU_WANT_TO_STORE_MESSAGES_IN_CASE_OF_ERRORS>"    # Eg:- deadletter.layer = "index-layer"

# These settings are for the Data Client Library used in the Data Archiving Library.

  # Stream layers are implemented as Kafka clusters.
  # To read from a stream layer, your application must use one of the following connector types:
  # "kafka-connector" - Direct Kafka is the preferred connector type since it directly communicates with the underlying Kafka cluster. It is the default connector.
  # "http-connector" - HTTP Connector is an HTTP wrapper on top of Kafka, and therefore implies a communication overhead. If your application needs to access data in the Marketplace or is running behind a proxy, use the HTTP connector.
