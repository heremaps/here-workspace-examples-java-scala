# A Compiler to Extract Pedestrian Topologies into Protobuf

This Data Processing Library Scala example shows how to use the
HERE Data SDK to build a compiler pipeline that extracts all pedestrian topologies for a
particular input catalog.

In this example, the incremental [RefTreeCompiler](https://developer.here.com/documentation/data-processing-library/dev_guide/topics/functional-patterns.html#reftreecompiler) functional pattern is used,
since this pattern covers use cases when some input partitions have references to other input partitions that should be resolved to process the subjects fully.

The implemented compiler takes HERE Map Content input data from the `road-attributes` and `topology-geometry` layers, finds all pedestrian topologies, and produces output
tiles in Protobuf Format. The output of this compiler is the `pedestriansegments` layer Protobuf
HERE Tile format.

For more information about `RefTreeCompiler` functional pattern, see the [`Data Processing Library Developer Guide`](https://developer.here.com/documentation/data-processing-library/dev_guide/topics/functional-patterns.html#reftreecompiler).

## Get Your Credentials

To run this example, you need two sets of credentials:

- **Platform credentials:** To get access to the platform data and resources, including HERE Map Content data for your pipeline input.
- **Repository credentials:** To download HERE Data SDK for Java & Scala libraries and Maven archetypes to your environment.

For more details on how to set up your credentials, see the [Identity & Access Management Developer Guide](https://developer.here.com/documentation/identity-access-management/dev_guide/index.html).

For more details on how to verify that your platform credentials are configured correctly, see the [Verify Your Credentials](https://developer.here.com/documentation/java-scala-dev/dev_guide/verify-credentials/index.html) tutorial.

## Build and Run the Compiler

In the commands that follow, replace the variable placeholders with the following values:

- `$CATALOG_ID` is your output catalog's ID.
- `$CATALOG_HRN` is your output catalog's `HRN` (returned by the `olp catalog create` command).
- `$HRN_PARTITION` is the platform environment you are in. The value should be `here`.
- `$PROJECT_HRN` is your project's `HRN` (returned by the `olp project create` command).
- `$REALM` is the ID of your organization, also called a realm. Consult your platform
  invitation letter to learn your organization ID.
- `$CATALOG_RIB` is the HRN of the public _HERE Map Content_ catalog in your pipeline configuration ([HERE environment](./compiler/config/here/pipeline-config.conf).

### Run the Compiler Locally

#### Create a Local Pedestrian Topologies Catalog

As mentioned above, we will use the public HERE Map Content input catalog, however, we need to create our own output catalog
to store the pedestrian topologies generated by the compiler.

To run this compiler locally, use a local output catalog as described
below. For more information about local catalogs, see
[the SDK tutorial about local development and testing](https://developer.here.com/documentation/java-scala-dev/dev_guide/local-development-workflow/index.html)
and [the OLP CLI documentation](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/local-data-workflows.html).

1. Use the [`olp local catalog create`](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/local-data/catalog-commands.html#catalog-create)
   command to create a local catalog.

```bash
olp local catalog create pedestrian-topologies-scala "Pedestrian Topologies Catalog" \
            --summary "Pedestrian topologies extracted from HERE Map Content" \
            --description "Pedestrian topologies extracted from HERE Map Content"
```

The local catalog will have the HRN `hrn:local:data:::pedestrian-topologies-scala`.

2. Use the [`olp local catalog layer add`](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/local-data/layer-commands.html#catalog-layer-add)
   command to add two `versioned` layers to your catalog:

| Layer ID           | Layer Type | Partitioning | Zoom Level | Content Type             | Content Encoding | Schema                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| pedestriansegments | Versioned  | HEREtile     | 14         | application/x-protobuf   | uncompressed     | Pedestrian Topologies Extraction Example Scala [^1] |
| state              | Versioned  | Generic      | N.A.       | application/octet-stream | uncompressed     | -                                                   |

[^1]:

The schema artifact is necessary for the platform portal to display the content of the protobuf
partitions in the layer. You can create and publish your own schemas using the
[Maven Archetypes for schema projects](https://developer.here.com/documentation/archetypes/dev_guide/topics/archetypes-schema.html).
For this example, we have pre-deployed a schema artifact for the
`pedestrian-topologies-extraction-protobuf/model` project, so you do not have to.

```bash
olp local catalog layer add hrn:local:data:::pedestrian-topologies-scala pedestriansegments pedestriansegments --versioned --summary "pedestrian segments" \
            --description "pedestrian segments" --partitioning heretile:14 --content-type application/x-protobuf \
            --schema hrn:$HRN_PARTITION:schema::$REALM:com.here.platform.schema.data.processing.example.scala.pedestrian.protobuf:model_v2:1.0.433
olp local catalog layer add hrn:local:data:::pedestrian-topologies-scala state state --versioned --summary "state" --description "state" \
            --partitioning Generic --content-type application/octet-stream
```

The schema artifact is necessary for the platform portal to display the content of the protobuf
partitions in the layer. You can create and publish your own schemas using the
[Maven Archetypes for schema projects](https://developer.here.com/documentation/archetypes/dev_guide/topics/archetypes-schema.html).
For this example, we have pre-deployed a schema artifact for the
[`pedestrian-topologies-extraction-protobuf/model`](../pedestrian-topologies-extraction-protobuf/model) project, so you do not have to.

#### Build the Output Data Schema

To build the schema, run the following command in the [`pedestrian-topologies-extraction-protobuf/model`](../pedestrian-topologies-extraction-protobuf/model) directory.

```bash
mvn install
```

#### Build the Compiler

To build the compiler, run the following command in the [`pedestrian-topologies-extraction-protobuf/compiler`](../pedestrian-topologies-extraction-protobuf/compiler) directory.

```bash
sbt package
```

#### Run the Compiler from the Command Line

To run the compiler locally, you will need to run the entry point to the compiler:

- `com.here.platform.data.processing.example.scala.pedestrian.protobuf.Main`

As arguments, you must provide the `-Dspark.master` parameter with the address of the Spark server
master to connect to, and any configuration parameters you want to override. Alternatively, you
can add those parameters to the [`application.conf`](compiler/config/here/local-application.conf) file.

Additionally, you also need to specify the `-Dpipeline-config.file` and `-Dpipeline-job.file` parameters
to define the location of a configuration file that contains the catalogs as well as job-specific versions
of the catalogs, to read and write to.

For local runs, a bounding box filter is provided in the
[`config/here/local-application.conf`](compiler/config/here/local-application.conf) to
limit the number of partitions to be processed. This speeds up the compilation process. In this
example, we use a bounding box around the cities of Berlin. You can edit the bounding box coordinates to compile a different
partition of HERE Map Content. Make sure you update the layer coverage to reflect the different
geographical region. In order to use this configuration file, you need to use the `-Dconfig.file`
parameter.

Set the environment variable `$PATH_TO_CONFIG_FOLDER` to [`./config/here`](compiler/config/here).

Finally, run the following command line in the [`pedestrian-topologies-extraction-protobuf/compiler`](../pedestrian-topologies-extraction-protobuf/compiler) directory
to run the Pedestrian Topologies Compiler.

For the HERE platform environment:

```bash
sbt run \
-Dpipeline-config.file=./config/here/local-pipeline-config.conf \
-Dpipeline-job.file=./config/here/pipeline-job.conf \
-Dconfig.file=./config/here/local-application.conf \
-Dspark.master=local[*]
```

After one run, in the HERE platform environment, you can inspect the local catalog with the OLP CLI:

```
olp local catalog inspect hrn:local:data:::pedestrian-topologies-scala
```

You should see the list of partitions with pedestrian topologies:

### Run this Compiler as a HERE Platform Pipeline

#### Configure a Project

To follow this example, you will need a [project](https://developer.here.com/documentation/identity-access-management/dev_guide/topics/manage-projects.html). A project is a collection of platform resources
(catalogs, pipelines, and schemas) with controlled access. You can create a project through the
[HERE platform portal](https://platform.here.com/).

Alternatively, use the OLP CLI [`olp project create`](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/project/project-commands.html#create-project) command to create the project:

```bash
olp project create $PROJECT_ID $PROJECT_NAME
```

The command returns the [HERE Resource Name (HRN)](https://developer.here.com/documentation/data-user-guide/user_guide/index.html) of your new project. Note down this HRN as you will need it later in this tutorial.

> #### Note
>
> You do not have to provide a `--scope` parameter if your app has a default scope.
> For details on how to set a default project scope for an app, see the _Specify a
> default Project_ for Apps chapter of the [Identity & Access Management Developer Guide](https://developer.here.com/documentation/identity-access-management/dev_guide/index.html).

For more information on how to work with projects, see the [Organize your work in projects](https://developer.here.com/documentation/java-scala-dev/dev_guide/organize-work-in-projects/index.html) tutorial.

#### Create a Pedestrian Topologies Catalog

Create a catalog to store the pedestrian topologies generated by the compiler.

1. Use the [`olp catalog create`](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/data/catalog-commands.html#catalog-create) command to create the catalog.
   Make sure to note down the HRN returned by the following command for later use:

```bash
olp catalog create $CATALOG_ID $CATALOG_ID --summary "Pedestrian topologies extracted from HERE Map Content" \
            --description "Pedestrian topologies extracted from HERE Map Content" \
            --scope $PROJECT_HRN
```

2. Use the [`olp catalog layer add`](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/data/layer-commands.html#catalog-layer-add) command to add two `versioned` layers to your catalog:

```bash
olp catalog layer add $CATALOG_HRN pedestriansegments pedestriansegments --versioned --summary "pedestrian segments" \
            --description "pedestrian segments" --partitioning heretile:14 --content-type application/x-protobuf \
            --schema hrn:$HRN_PARTITION:schema::$REALM:com.here.platform.schema.data.processing.example.scala.pedestrian.protobuf:model_v2:1.0.433 \
            --scope $PROJECT_HRN
olp catalog layer add $CATALOG_HRN state state --versioned --summary "state" --description "state" \
            --partitioning Generic --content-type application/octet-stream \
            --scope $PROJECT_HRN
```

> #### Note::
>
> If a billing tag is required in your realm, use the `--billing-tags: "YOUR_BILLING_TAG"` parameter.

3. Use the [`olp project resource link`](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/project/project-link-commands.html#project-resource-link) command to link the _HERE Map Content_ catalog to your project:

```bash
olp project resource link $PROJECT_HRN $CATALOG_RIB
```

- For more details on catalog commands, see [Catalog Commands](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/data/catalog-commands.html).
- For more details on layer commands, see [Layer Commands](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/data/layer-commands.html).
- For more details on project commands, see [Project Commands](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/project/project-commands.html).
- For instructions on how to link a resource to a project, see [Project Resource Link command](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/project/project-link-commands.html#project-resource-link).

#### Configure the Compiler

From the SDK examples directory, open the `data-processing/scala/pedestrian-topologies-extraction-protobuf` project in your
Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

The `compiler/config/here/pipeline-config.conf` (for the HERE platform environment) file contains
the permanent configuration of the data sources for the compiler.

Pick the file that corresponds to your platform environment. For example, the pipeline configuration for
the HERE platform environment looks like:

```javascript
pipeline.config {
  output-catalog {hrn = "YOUR_OUTPUT_CATALOG_HRN"}
  input-catalogs {
    rib {hrn = "hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2"}
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_OUTPUT_CATALOG_HRN` with the HRN of your pedestrian topologies catalog.
To find the HRN, in the [HERE platform portal](https://platform.here.com/), navigate to your catalog. The HRN is displayed in the upper
left corner of the page.

The `compiler/config/here/pipeline-job.conf` file
contains the compiler's run configuration.

In this file, modify `version = 1` to reflect the version of the HERE Map Content catalog you want
to process. To find the version of the HERE Map Content catalog, in the
[HERE platform portal](https://platform.here.com/),
navigate to the HERE Map Content catalog, and view the current catalog's version in the Catalog info section.

The remainder of the configuration is specified in the `application.conf` file that can be found in the
`src/main/resources` directory of the compiler project. However, you do not have to modify it unless
you want to change the behavior of the compiler.

#### Generate a Fat JAR file

Run the `sbt assembly` command in the `pedestrian-topologies-extraction-protobuf/compiler`
directory to generate a fat JAR file to deploy the compiler to a pipeline.

```bash
sbt assembly
```

#### Deploy the Compiler to a Pipeline

Once the previous command is finished, your JAR is then available at the `target` directory, and you
can upload it using the [HERE pipeline UI](https://platform.here.com/pipelines)
or the [OLP CLI](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli).

You can use the OLP CLI to create pipeline components and activate the pipeline version with the following commands:

1. [Create](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/pipeline-workflows.html) pipeline components:

For this example, a bounding box filter is provided by `--runtime-config` parameter to
limit the number of partitions to be processed. This speeds up the compilation process. In this
example, we use a bounding box around the cities of Berlin. You can edit the bounding box coordinates to compile a different
partition of HERE Map Content. Make sure you update the layer coverage to reflect the different
geographical region.

```bash
olp pipeline create $COMPONENT_NAME_Pipeline --scope $PROJECT_HRN
olp pipeline template create $COMPONENT_NAME_Template batch-4.0 $PATH_TO_JAR \
                com.here.platform.data.processing.example.scala.pedestrian.protobuf.Main \
                --workers=4 --worker-units=3 --supervisor-units=2 --input-catalog-ids=rib \
                --scope $PROJECT_HRN
olp pipeline version create $COMPONENT_NAME_version $PIPELINE_ID $PIPELINE_TEMPLATE_ID \
                "$PATH_TO_CONFIG_FOLDER/pipeline-config.conf" \
                --runtime-config  here.platform.data-processing.executors.partitionKeyFilters.0.className=BoundingBoxFilter \
                                  here.platform.data-processing.executors.partitionKeyFilters.0.param.boundingBox.north=52.67551 \
                                  here.platform.data-processing.executors.partitionKeyFilters.0.param.boundingBox.south=52.338261 \
                                  here.platform.data-processing.executors.partitionKeyFilters.0.param.boundingBox.east=13.76116 \
                                  here.platform.data-processing.executors.partitionKeyFilters.0.param.boundingBox.west=13.08835 \
                --scope $PROJECT_HRN
```

2. [Activate](https://developer.here.com/documentation/open-location-platform-cli/user_guide/topics/pipeline/version-commands.html#pipeline-version-activate) the pipeline version:

```bash
olp pipeline version activate $PIPELINE_ID $PIPELINE_VERSION_ID \
                --input-catalogs "$PATH_TO_CONFIG_FOLDER/pipeline-job.conf" \
                --scope $PROJECT_HRN
```

You do not have to specify the input catalog's version, unless you want
to. The latest version will be automatically used.

In the [HERE platform portal](https://platform.here.com/pipelines),
navigate to your pipeline to see its status.

## Verify the Output

In the [HERE platform portal](https://platform.here.com/),
select the **Data** tab and find your catalog.

- Open the `pedestriansegments` layer and select the **Inspect** tab.

Different partitions should be present.
