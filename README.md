# HERE Workspace Examples for Java and Scala Developers

## Introduction

This repository holds a series of Java and Scala examples, that demonstrate typical use cases for the HERE Workspace â€“ a part of HERE platform. HERE Workspace is an environment to enrich, transform and deploy location-centric data.
Go to [HERE platform](https://developer.here.com/products/open-location-platform) to learn more. If you are interested in knowing what the platform offers specifically for Java and Scala developers, visit [this page](https://developer.here.com/documentation/sdk-developer-guide/dev_guide/index.html).

## Prerequisites

In order to run the examples, you need to have a HERE Workspace account. If you do not have an account, navigate to [Pricing and Plans](https://developer.here.com/pricing/open-location-platform) to apply for a free trial.

You need to get access credentials and prepare your environment. For more information on how to prepare your environment, see our [guide for Java and Scala developers](https://developer.here.com/documentation/sdk-developer-guide/dev_guide/topics/how-to-use-sdk.html).

## Code Examples

### Processing Sensor Data

The following documents illustrate two use cases around inferring real-world situations from sensor data. [Batch processing](https://developer.here.com/documentation/java-scala-dev/dev_guide/topics/example-use-cases.html#use-case-map-of-recommended-speed-based-on-sensor-observations-and-other-data) is useful when it is important to aggregate sensor input over a longer time period (that is hours and longer). [Stream processing](https://developer.here.com/documentation/java-scala-dev/dev_guide/topics/example-use-cases.html#use-case-turning-sensor-data-into-warnings) is recommended for time-critical use cases, like informing about road hazards.

| Infer Stop Sign Locations from Automotive Sensor Observations | The example takes archived sensor data, clusters and path-matches it in a distributed Spark batch environment, and creates a map layer with stop signs at the output.                                   | [Scala](location/scala/spark/infer-stop-signs-from-sensors) | Location Library, Data Client Library, Spark, Batch, GeoJSON, SDII |
| Stream Path Matcher                                           | The example stands for a similar but time critical use case. It does not hash out anything but map matching. It takes sensor data from a stream, map-matches it in Flink, and puts on an output stream. | [Java](location/java/flink/stream-path-matcher)             | Location Library, Data Client Library, Flink, Stream, SDII         |

### Archiving Stream Data

The HERE Workspace allows you to retain stream data for longer periods, which allows you to later query and process the retained data for non-real-time use cases.
For more information, see [Data Archiving Library Developer Guide](https://developer.here.com/documentation/data-archiving-library/dev_guide/index.html).

### Compacting Index Data

The HERE Workspace allows you to compact data files with the same index attribute values into one or more files based on the configuration.
Compaction reduces the index layer storage cost, improves query performance, and makes subsequent data processing more efficient.
For more information, see [Index Compaction Library Developer Guide](https://developer.here.com/documentation/index-compaction-library/dev_guide/index.html).
