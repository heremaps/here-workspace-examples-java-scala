# Contributing Guide

## Introduction

The team behind the [HERE Workspace Examples for Java and Scala Developers](here-workspace-examples-java-scala) gratefully accepts contributions via
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) filed against the
[GitHub project](https://github.com/heremaps/here-workspace-examples-java-scala/pulls).

## Signing each Commit

As part of filing a pull request we ask you to sign off the
[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) in each commit.
Any Pull Request with commits that are not signed off will be reject by the
[DCO check](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/).

A DCO is lightweight way for a contributor to confirm that you wrote or otherwise have the right
to submit code or documentation to a project. Simply add `Signed-off-by` as shown in the example below
to indicate that you agree with the DCO.

An example signed commit message:

```
README.md: Fix minor spelling mistake

Signed-off-by: John Doe


Git has the `-s` flag that can sign a commit for you, see example below:

`$ git commit -s -m 'README.md: Fix minor spelling mistake'`
```
